# INE5608-Systems-Analysis-and-Design

Repository dedicated to the project of Systems Analysis and Design, discipline taught in the Information Systems bachelor at UFSC.
<p>This course focuses on carrying out an entire project from analysis to implementation.

So, me and two other students (Luis Enrique and Leopoldo) created:

# Vá de Bike!

<p>The system's main objective is to improve the urban mobility of large cities through bicycles.
<p>The application will manage all bicycle rental between users, thus helping the access to bicycles for those who do not have one and will generate an extra source of income for those who make their bikes available.
<p>With Vá de Bike! will be two user profiles: Lessor and Lessee:
<p>Lessor: provide bikes for rental
<p>Renter: rent bikes from lessors

<p>The whole system will be implemented in Java SE with Swing.
<p>The database used is MySQL.
